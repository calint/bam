[x] o1store: consider replacing alloc_ix with pointer to array element
    removing array look-ups vs free_, alloc_, del_ would hold pointers (x4 space usage)
[ ] game_object: position relative to tile map or screen
[ ] consider locking dt to 30 fps for deterministic behavior
[ ] horizontal, vertical flip of sprite
[ ] several sets of tiles cycled for animation
[ ] render_scanline(...) consider looping through allocated sprites instead of all
[ ] o1store: can_allocate() is not thread safe
[ ] o1store: hang if overrun?
[ ] o1store: consider using std::vector instead of calloc and free
[ ] o1store: consider a minimal implementation of span to return allocated list
[ ] #define O1STORE_DEBUG to check for double free, index out of bounds
[ ] modifiable tiles map
[ ] vectorized functions:
    #include <esp32-hal-vector.h>
    float a[4] = {1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5};
    float b[4] = {0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5};
    float result[4];
    vaddf(result, a, b, 4);
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[x] keep engine 'object' minimalistic and extract logic and update to 'game_object'
[x] display_width and height is defined in engine.hpp but is device dependent
    => extracted to 'platform.hpp' as platform dependent constant
[x] animated sprite class {sprite_img,ms}
    => animation implemented ad-hoc in 'game/objects/ship2.hpp'
[x] separate palette for sprites and tiles
[x] extract files into headers/source
[x] collision detection: bit field for type and collision interest
[-] o1store: consider std::array instead of pointers
    => done with pointer shenanigans
[x] o1store: consider using pointers instead indexes in arrays
[x] o1store: return pointer to object instead of reference.
    nullptr if allocation could not be done.
[x] sprite allocation for active objects
    => O(1) sprite allocation and free
[x] make sprite allocation class into a template
    => o1store
[x] objects composed of several sprites
[x] separate concept of sprite and object
[x] polymorphism without allocation on the heap
    => 'new' in place
[x] replace #define with constexpr
    => somewhat worse because it is unclear by naming what is constant
       consider reverting to 'defines' including other constexpr or naming captialized?
